# DeepLearningCodes
Codes built while learning basics of Deep Learning.

Codes in this repository were mainly part of the exercise sessions of the course **Artificial Neural Networks in Structural Mechanics** at RWTH Aachen University. Furthermore, this rrepository also contains the primary 
(probably underdeveloped) PINN for the case of the bar under uniform tensile tension. This problem was given as part of an interview for a student job at the Department of Continuum Mechanics at RWTH. Since I got another offer,
I left the PINN partially incomplete.
